				<h1>Rules</h1>
				<h2>Game objectives</h2>
				<p>
					To make the maximum number of points by taking turns to
					place one, two or three tokens crossword-style on the
					board.
				</p>
				<h2>Game creation</h2>
				<p>
					A game can be created from the home page. When creating a
					game, the number of players must be defined (between two
					and four).
				</p>
				<p>
					When a game is created, an invite link is created (available
					from the home page) and must be sent to the other players
					so they can join it. The game starts when all the players
					joined the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					The player starting the game is choosen randomly.
				</p>
				<h2>How to play</h2>
				<p>
					Turn by turn, the players place one, two or three tokens
					from their hand onto the board. Tokens must be placed
					horizontally or vertically, but must alwayes touch at least
					one of the previously placed token.
				</p>
				<p>
					A maximum of three tokens can be aligned side by side
					(horizontally of vertically) and the tokens played at a
					given turn must be aligned (although not necessarily
					touching each other, they can, for example, surround a third
					token).
				</p>
				<p>
					Each set of three tokens must add up exactly 15. Each set of
					2 tokens must add up 15 or less.
				</p>
				<h3>First turn</h3>
				<p>
					For the first turn, one of the played tokens must be placed
					on the center space of the board.
				</p>
				<h3>Points counting</h3>
				<p>
					Points are counted by adding up the total values of the
					tokens:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Placing token <span class="token">2</span> next to
							token <span class="token">4</span> on the board would
							be worth 6 points.
						</li>
						<li>
							Placing token <span class="token">7</span> with token
							<span class="token">8</span>,
							<span class="token">7</span> above token
							<span class="token">2</span> would be worth
							be worth 24 points (7 + 2 down and 7 + 8 across).
						</li>
						<li>
							When completing a row or column of three tokens
							(therefore summing them to 15), the player will get
							the sum of them (15) plus a 15 points bonus. For
							example, placing a <span class="token">2</span> next
							to a <span class="token">9</span> and a
							<span class="token">4</span> would give 30 points.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a player's hand sums exactly 15 points and the
							player can play them all at once, a bonus of 50
							points will be granted, making the score at least 80
							points (30 for completing a set of 3 tokens, 50 for
							emptying the hand), plus the points of the adjacent
							tokens.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h3>Special spaces</h3>
				<p>
					There are 4 different special spaces on the board:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Doubles and triples: When a token is plaed over a
							<b>double</b> or a <b>triple</b> space, the value of
							that token is doubled or tripled. If the played
							token completes a row or column of three tokens, the
							whole 30 points that the player would have got are
							doubled or tripled (granting 60 or 90 points).
						<li>
							The center space must be used on the first turn, and
							acts as a <b>double</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Repeat: when playing on a repeat space, the player
							will be able to play a second time (after redrawing
							tokens to fill his/her hand). Repeat spaces are
							cumulative, if after a <b>repeat</b> the player
							plays again on another one, he/she will be able to
							play a third time.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>End of the game and winner</h2>
				<p>
					The game ends when all the tokens are played and the winner
					is the player having scored the highest cumulative score.
